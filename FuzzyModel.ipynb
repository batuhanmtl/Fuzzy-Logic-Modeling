The first step to apply fuzzy logic to a system is to determine the inputs and outputs of the system.

For these expectations, fuzzy logic The inputs of the model and all parameters are very important. The inputs to be applied to the problem are the amount of laundry, the degree of soiling and the type of laundry. These inputs will determine the amount of detergent to be used by the machine.\n",
